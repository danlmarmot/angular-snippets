  <p>Why this page?  Well, I needed to pass in values to Angular.js controllers, and 
  realized there is a lot of discussion, there isn't a practical listing of examples...
  hence this page.  </p>
  <p>There 

    <hr>
    <div ng-init="stupid='golden maple syrup'" ng-controller="FoodParentCtrl">
    <h3>1.  Declare the variable in the controller's HTML tag.</h3>

      <p>A simple method for injecting a static variable when you create a controller.  To
      use in your .js file, you can bind it to $scope and then use it.  In the following case,
      that variable is named $scope.foods, and the expected value is "golden maple syrup".
      
      </p>Result: <i>{{foods}}</i>

    <h3>ng-init method</h3>

      <p>Inject a variable directly into the $scope of the controller with ng-init.
      No need to use $scope or anything, just use the naked variable name.
      </p>Result: <i>{{stupid}}</i>

    <h3>2. Use the factory!</h3>

      <p>Request a simple value from a factory with a no-parameter method</p>
      
      Result: <i>{{factoryFoods}}</i>

    <h3>3. Use the factory, with a parameter!</h3>

      <p>Request a value from a factory method.  Declare a value, then assign the
      $scope.&lt;variable&gt; to the result of function call.  Again, the action's all in 
      the app.js file.</p>Result:
      <ul>
        
      <li><i>{{factoryFoodsTaco}}</i></li>
      <li><i>{{factoryFoodsSushi}}</i></li>
      </ul>

    <h3>4.  Use the factory, but use values defined in Javascript outside of angular</h3>

      <p>Use the factory to access global window variables.  This was the original problem
      I was solving--I wanted my Angular page to be driven by variables declared in index.html,
      and not in some Angular service or other .js file.   I need to use index.html as I'm 
      moving over web pages generated with Python Flask, and it's easy in Flask  to 
      return a single index.html file the the HTTP browser client that's rendered by the Flask template engine.
      
      Again, the action is in app.js.
      
        <br>Expect breakfast and dinner!</p>Result: <i>{{mealNames}}</i>
        
    <h3>5.  Use a Window variable to create repeating child contollers, each handling a single array value.</h3>
    
        <p> This just shows a way to have a Angular.js repeating controller that's bound to items in an Javascript array declared in index.html.<p>
          <table class="t1">
          <tr ng-repeat="meal in mealNames" ng-controller="MealItemsCtrl">
            <td>{{meal}} (and here it is with an s on the end): {{itemPlural}}</td>
          </tr>
          </table>

    </div>
  </body>
